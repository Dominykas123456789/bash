# Bash scripts

These are my bash scripts. The directory structure (and some
cool stuff) was shamelessly stolen from @fnando
(https://github.com/fnando/bash) =]

So, quoting him:

Just clone this repository to `~/.bash` and
add the following line to your `~/.bash_profile`
or equivalent file:

  source ~/.bash/init.sh
